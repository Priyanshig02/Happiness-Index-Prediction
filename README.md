# Problem Statement:
Predicting National Happiness Index: A Comprehensive Analysis of Socio
Economic Factors Using Multiple Linear Regression and various other Machine 
Learning Techniques. 
In recent years, the measurement of national happiness has gained significant 
attention as a crucial indicator of societal well-being and progress. This study 
aims to develop a robust predictive model for estimating the happiness index of 
countries based on various socio-economic factors. The primary objective is to 
utilize multiple linear regression as a baseline model and compare its performance 
with other advanced machine learning algorithms. 

# Data Description :
 
The project relies on accuracy of data. The data has been collected from World 
Happiness Report (WHR) 2024. This report used the data which was collected on 
the basis of Gallup World Poll (GWP). The survey measure of SWB (Subjective 
Well-being) is from the February 15, release of the Gallup World Poll (GWP). 
The Gallup World Poll (GWP) is indeed a widely recognized survey conducted 
by Gallup, an American analytics and advisory company. It measures various 
aspects of people's lives, including subjective well-being (SWB), across different 
countries and regions around the world. Subjective well-being typically 
encompasses factors such as happiness, life satisfaction, and overall quality of 
life, as perceived by individuals themselves. The GWP provides valuable insights 
into global trends and disparities in well-being, helping policymakers and 
researchers understand the factors that contribute to people's happiness 
and satisfaction.
